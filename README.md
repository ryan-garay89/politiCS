Parks, schools, and office buildings stand abandoned as their former inhabitants stay
home. Families and friends spend time together over Zoom rather than face-to-face. Patients die
alone in quarantined wards, rather than in the arms of their loved ones. The COVID-19 pandemic
has transformed life as we knew it. Originally contracted in Wuhan, China, the Coronavirus is an
infectious disease with varying degrees of impact on individuals who contract it. Some
individuals report experiencing no symptoms, while others experience prolonged, painful
symptoms like headaches, fatigue, fever, loss of taste/smell, etc. The mortality rate of the
Coronavirus is about 2.29%, with 1.54 million individuals dead out of the 67.3 million who have
contracted the virus worldwide (on December 7, 2020).

According to the CDC, the Coronavirus is spread largely through infected people’s
respiratory droplets. Most infections happen when unmasked people are within 6 feet of someone
who has the Coronavirus and that person is engaging in activities that produce respiratory
droplets, such as coughing, talking, and breathing heavily. It is less commonly spread through
airborne transmission (respiratory droplets remaining in the air and/or traveling further than 6
feet) and contact (respiratory droplets being gathered from surfaces) (Evidence). Seeing as the
Coronavirus tends to spread the most between people in close proximity, our group wondered if
the populations of prisons—institutions infamous for lack of space and overcrowding—were
disproportionately affected by the pandemic.

Our research investigated the proportion of each state’s prison population that contracted
the Coronavirus. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, as of December 7, 2020, 5,555
inmates and 1,613 BOP staff nationwide have tested positive for COVID-19, while 22,612
inmates and 2,101 BOP staff have recovered. We used a dataset that showed us how COVID-19
spread inside prisons (number of positive cases and deaths) in different states. After analyzing
our data, we found a strong positive correlation between the number of incarcerated individuals
(x) and the number of infected individuals within a states’ prison system (y). The correlation
coefficient was 0.86644066, indicating that states with larger prison populations tend to also
have larger populations of prisoners that have contracted the virus, as seen in the scatterplot
below.

More detailed analysis of our dataset suggests that some states, such as Florida, had a
worse outbreak in their prison systems despite having a lower number of prisoners on average. A
possible reason for this could be because Florida was one of 16 states to abolish discretionary
parole in 1983 (Toohey). Many prisoners in Florida who died from coronavirus were eligible for
parole, but the state did not change their release dates despite the ongoing public health
emergency. Furthermore, while states like California and Washington are attempting to reduce
their prison population as they understand that criminal justice institutions are breeding grounds
for the virus, Florida has not, and the state’s Department of Corrections also lacks the authority
to release prisoners before they finish serving their sentence. This led the number of positive
COVID-19 cases among the prison population in Florida to surge from 2,591 in mid-July to
14,271 in August (Ceballos). Only Florida’s governor and Cabinet have the power to relieve the
crisis within prisons. Despite pressure from Democratic lawmakers urging the governor to
protect prisoners and corrections officers, Governor Ron DeSantis stated that “I don’t see how in
a time of pandemic where people are on edge already [that] releasing felons in society would
make a whole lot of sense,” since he believes inmates are dangerous and there are no alternative
facilities available to house them (Sun Sentinel Editorial Board). Instead, Governor DeSantis has
attempted to relieve the health crisis in prisons by allocating more testing resources to criminal
justice facilities, claiming that they receive the most resources from the state second to nursing
homes. While the government has not proven effective in controlling the spread of COVID in
Florida prisons, efforts have been made from judges and attorneys who are cognizant of the
issue. The actual prison population in Miami-Dade County jails dropped from a reported 4,000
people before the pandemic to 3,200 after. The case study of Florida is an indicator that it is
difficult to mitigate COVID effects without top-down policy initiatives.

Texas seems to have had the largest outbreak of all states, with an average of 14% of
their prison population contracting COVID-19. According to a report from the University of
Texas at Austin, prisoners in Texas have a 40% higher chance of contracting COVID-19
compared to the rest of the nation. The state’s death rate is also 35% higher than the national
prison population. Similar to Florida, a large number of incarcerated Texans that died from
coronavirus were approved or eligible for parole or had not yet been convicted of a crime.
Furthermore, when the pandemic started, Ohio, Texas, New Jersey, and Michigan had the most
prison deaths in the US, with around 30-40 inmates dying each month. While Ohio, New Jersey,
and Michigan were able to drastically reduce their death rate so that only around 5 inmates were
dying each month by processing parole and releasing inmates with minor nonviolent infractions,
Texas was the only state that still had around 30 deaths per month, suggesting that the state has
not done enough to address the outbreak within prisons (Rosenzweig-Ziff).

On the other hand, New York is the fourth most populated state in the US but had a
relatively small outbreak, and a relatively small number of incarcerated individuals on average.
Some much smaller states had worse outbreaks and higher incarceration numbers on average
compared to New York. As of late October, Governor Cuomo has allowed the state’s
Department of Correction to release 2,252 inmates with nonviolent, nonsex offenses who were
within 90 days of their approved release date and 791 individuals with low-level parole
violations in an effort to reduce the number of positive cases in prisons (Robinson). Furthermore,
at the local level, New York has released all low-level technical parole violators. Inmates and
corrections workers are also given face masks and are subject to quarantine and self-isolation.
Bunk beds are being “debunked” to reduce the physical proximity of prisoners who share cells,
suggesting that New York has been dealing with the pandemic by reducing the prison population
and implementing safety policies to quell the spread of the virus within criminal justice facilities.
Clearly, prison overcrowding is having devastating effects on the United States’ prison
population, and policies need to be changed before more people lose their lives to the virus.
Aside from overcrowding, there are other factors that contribute to the U.S. prison population
being disproportionately affected by the Coronavirus. One factor is the unhygienic condition of
U.S. prisons. Dr. Brie Williams, a Professor of Medicine of the University of California, San
Francisco, visited a California prison a few months into the pandemic and condemned the
conditions as “unsanitary” and “poorly ventilated”—two characteristics that make prisons an
ideal breeding ground for the virus (Evidence). Similarly, prisoners have underlying conditions
that put them at greater risk of the virus. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, “[i]n
2011-12, half of state and federal prisoners and local jail inmates reported ever having a chronic
condition. Chronic conditions include cancer, high blood pressure, stroke-related problems,
diabetes, heart-related problems, kidney-related problems, arthritis, asthma, and cirrhosis of the
liver.” Many, if not all, of these conditions translate to a greater risk of fatality if these prisoners
were to become infected with the Coronavirus.

However, several states have taken initiative to preemptively limit the spread of
COVID-19 through measures that decrease prison populations. California is among the first
states to take action, reducing bail to $0 for most misdemeanors and some low-level offenses.
Additionally, in the August 2020 California Supreme Court case In re Humphrey, the Supreme
Court ruled that courts must take into account a defendant's financial circumstances when setting
bail. These measures were created to reduce inequalities in the system, but they were also in
response to the pandemic in an effort to reduce prison populations. The ongoing decisions that
have been made to reduce bail have proven to be effective, with Los Angeles and Sacramento
counties seeing a 30% decrease in jail populations and Orange County seeing a 45% drop.
Other states have not made such fundamental policy changes in their court systems, but
have been releasing more prisoners due to the unique nature of the pandemic. New York is one
of the primary states with several counties doing so, which may be a potential reason for its
relatively small outbreak. For example, the Westchester County Jail in Valhalla released
individuals due to a decision from the District Attorney and the Legal Aid Society of
Westchester. Many other counties in Oregon, Pennsylvania, and other states have seen a decline
in overall jail populations. On a federal level, Attorney General Barr has instructed the BOP to
review inmates that are at high risk for COVID-19 to be considered for home confinement in
select areas. There are currently 8,017 BOP inmates in home confinement because of this.
As an initiative to minimize those affected by the disease in prisons, the World Health
Organization has created a guide and checklist to insure “preparedness, prevention, and control
of COVID-19 in prisons”. Examples of information include approaches to using masks, physical
distancing, how to assess cases, and case management. This handbook is publicly available for
prisons to use on the World Health Organization website. However, due to the Trump
Administration’s aversion towards the WHO, the country has not followed many of their
instructions.

Ultimately, with a lack of strong initiative from the federal government in response to the
pandemic, states have seen varied results in the outbreak of COVID-19 in their prisons. Many
states have had to utilize creativity in their policy responses to improve the situations, while
others have made lackluster efforts. It is important to research potential solutions to this
widespread problem to prevent the further loss of human life.
